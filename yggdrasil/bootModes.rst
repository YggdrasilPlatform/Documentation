Boot Modes
==========

On Yggdrasil, a 2 bit DIP switch can be found above the Display. The value configured on it is used during bootup of the plugged in World Board to determine where to boot from.

Since the configuration varies between different SoCs, here's a list of all possible modes for all existing World Boards.
